    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Nikolay Zakirov, a third year computing science student at Simon Fraser University. 
        I have always been more of a self-starter when I find something I am passionate about. 
        I tend to produce my best work on my own where I can dive deep into the details of the project 
        and come up with unique solutions to complex problems. In my third year here at SFU I have undertaken 
        the role as Project Manager for Introduction to Software Engineering (CMPT 295). This position brings 
        many challenges as I must organize myself and three other peers for the on time completion of group 
        projects and assignments while maintaining a high degree of quality.</p>

        <h3>TFT Board Solver</h3>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/NikolayZak/TFT_Board_Solver" target="_blank">Project Page</a></li>
        <p>My first big project started in first year (2022) where I felt confident enough with my programming skills 
            to take on my first project to be developed in C. The original TFT Board Solver parced txt files which 
            contained all the relevant information. This allowed for flexibility as TFT is a game where the dataset 
            is changing every six months. This approach continued all the way through to it's current state however, 
            more fields of data were later implemented. The first versions of the TFT Board solver struggled to solve 
            for boards of size 7 or greater. Reason being for solving an n sized board the number of possible boards 
            is O(n!). using permutations and many optimizations I learned in class I've gotten the TFT Board Solver down 
            to a O(59 choose n) worst case. I've created a recursive prunning algorithm that only computes 'promising' 
            boards and a specialized vector which is four times faster than std::vector! After lots of work on the project 
            the system is now able to determine all of the best boards (based on traits) for a size 9 board in 7 seconds. 
            That's over 12.5 billion unique permutations of boards it searches through!

        <p>Here is how I created my own bit-based vector class which is faster than std::vector with several limitations. 
            The vector has no reference to which element was placed in what order. The vector cannot hold duplicates. 
            The vector cannot hold values outside of 0-63. Despite these limitations, there are pleanty of use cases 
            for such a vector and should be implemented if needed, for instance, the TFT_Board_Solver.

        <h3>Blackjack Hand Calculator</h3>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/NikolayZak/Blackjack" target="_blank">Project Page</a></li>
        <p>In the summer of second year, I became interested in the probability of blackjack hands. Being somewhat similar 
            to my TFT Board Solver project, I decided to program the odds of blackjack. Since this was nothing new, I used 
            and compared well know statistics on the game to help fine-tune and verify my algorithm which also uses recursive 
            prunning. After a couple of months working on and off I've gotten the project to produce calculations faster than 
            Wizzard of Odds which is the official blackjack hand calculator. Unlike every other blackjack hand calculator, 
            I have decided to take on the challenge of computing the expected value of any given Blackjack Shoe. The reason online 
            resources for such a calculation does not really exist is because it can take over an hour with a standard algorithm.
            I am attempting to wittle the computational time down to under 5 minutes. Currently my algorithm is able to produce 
            results after 20 minutes but still has room for pleanty of optimizations I am working on implementing.</p>
